Architecture Explanation: This architecture is designed for high availability and scalability to handle 10,000+ concurrent users.

Networking: Uses a VPC with Public and Private subnets across two Availability Zones for fault tolerance.

Traffic Entry: Route 53 directs traffic to CloudFront (for static assets) and an Application Load Balancer (for dynamic requests). WAF protects the ALB from attacks.

Compute: The App Layer uses an Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances in private subnets, ensuring the system grows/shrinks based on traffic load.

Data: We use Amazon Aurora (Serverless/Provisioned) for a scalable SQL database and ElastiCache (Redis) to cache frequent queries, reducing database load.

Security: All compute and data resources are hidden in private subnets, accessible only via the ALB or Bastion host.
